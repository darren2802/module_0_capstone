## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
   1. It is a logical test that evaluates one or more boolean type tests to determine a course of action, for example:
      1. If I am feeling tired then I should sleep
      1. If the alarm clock is going off then it is time to get out of bed
      1. If I am thirsty then I should drink a glass of water, or if I am hungry then I should eat some food, or if I am thirsty and hungry then I should drink something and eat some food, otherwise I should continue coding

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
